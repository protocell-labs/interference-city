# ECHOGRID – Urban-Scale Radio Wave Visualizer

**ECHOGRID** is an interactive, WebGL-powered electromagnetic wave visualizer that simulates **radio wave interference** inside a 3D urban environment. The app loads a GLB model of a Hong Kong block section and visualizes how multiple electromagnetic emitters interfere through 3D space.

This project is a design prototype built with **Three.js** and **custom GLSL shaders**, developed during the Junction Utopia & Dystopia 2025 hackathon in Espoo, Finland.

## Features


* **3D electromagnetic interference field**

  * Fully real-time wave superposition using GPU shaders
  * Adjustable emitter positions, frequencies, and motion
  * Dense volumetric point cloud simulation

* **Interactive UI**

  * Control field size, density, source positions, and frequency in real time
  * Automatic source movement with wandering behavior
  * Multiple rendering modes (solid grid, wire grid, point field)

* **Urban-scale context**

  * Loads a **GLB model** of a Hong Kong building block
  * Scene navigation via OrbitControls

* **Custom wave physics**

  * Simple propagation model
  * Frequency-dependent phase and wavelength
  * Per-point height and color based on interference amplitude


## Not Implemented Yet

* **Obstacle occlusion / wave shadowing**
  The simulation currently ignores geometry collisions.
  Implementing real wave–geometry interaction is a planned future step.


## Technologies Used

* **Three.js** (renderer, camera, OrbitControls, GLB loading)
* **GLSL compute-style point shaders** (wave simulation)
* **WebGL 2**
* **GitHub Pages** for deployment
* **ChatGPT 5.1** as a coding and editing aid
